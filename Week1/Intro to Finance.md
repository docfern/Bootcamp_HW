# Unit 0: Intro to Finance
## Overview - Supplemental Content

###### In this module, we will cover some of the basics of finance as well as the mechanics of various financial models and markets. This module is supplemental to the curriculum, providing a crash-course and refresher into finance.

##### 0.1 Lesson Plan: What is Money?

##### ACTIVITY I:

###### Phone-a-Friend

In the first section of this module, we began exploring the definitions of value, money, and currency. These three concepts are often used interchangeably in colloquial use - how well do those around you know the differences?

###### Instructions

As a conversation starter amongst friends or family, ask What is money? Do their answers differ from what you've learned in this unit? How do their life experiences alter their definition?

###### ANSWER:

Defining money is not much the concern of my friends. Instead, their main focus is on how to obtain it. The stress of daily lives, such as earning money to put food on the table, diminishes their ability to even think of its definition, while some tend to spend the time enjoying the benefits of having it. To really sit down and think of defining the meaning of money never really comes to their mind due to the limited time of either looking for it or spending it quick. 

Consciously defining seemingly rests with the professorial and entrepreneurial world. My friend on the other hand finds it enigmatic and not worth trying to put their precious time. Most of my friends comprehend that money is indeed a medium of exchange and considered as one of the scarcest resources. They knew that the former President Nixon removed its gold backing and now it is only peg to nothing while relying heavily with government’s “capability”. Getting into experimenting with new currency that stores value scared them due to the latest scams especially in the multilevel marketing and by the fly-by-night trading.

##### ACTIVITY II:

###### Find a Statement

Now that we've discussed what is in a set of the most rudimentary financial statements let's explore what a real 10K or 10Q looks like.

###### Instructions
Using EDGAR or a Google search, try to find a copy of a company's 10K or 10Q. Identify the three major statements within it. Are there any line-items that you haven't heard of? What are additional items contained in an official document that we haven't covered here?

###### ANSWER:
LENDING CLUB (LC) 10Q REPORT: Our discussions cover the basics of Financial Reporting which includes the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. On the other hand, 10Q provides a comprehensive financial report of the company. It was delicately prepared by a company’s CFO and/or top Accountants and passed through the keen eyes of external auditors. All of these are to ensure trustworthiness in the public eye. The report includes a cover page, a basis of presentation and a summary of significant accounting policies for the sake of clarity. The 10Q includes Earnings per Share (EPS) and Debt-Equity Ratio which we haven’t discussed yet in our lessons – some financial ratios to be exact. Disclosures include Fair Value; Securitization and Variable Interest Entities; Property, Equipment and Software; Deferred Costs, Capitalized, Prepaid and other Asset Disclosure; Goodwill and Intangible Assets Disclosure; Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities; Debt Commitments and Contingencies; Restructuring Costs; Loans Held for Investments, Loans Held For Sale, Certificates and Secured Borrowings.<br>

##### 0.2 Lesson Plan: What is Risk?

##### ACTIVITY I:

###### Risk Self-Research

Now that we have discussed what risk is in general, are there any particular types of risk that you find interesting?

###### Instructions

Make a google search for types of risk. What kinds of risks did you find? Which of those pertain to financial risk? Of all of the types that you found, are there any that are fascinating to you, and why?

###### ANSWER:

There are four Financial risks that most businesses must contend with: Market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk. Market risk, in my humble opinion, is the hardest to deal with because it is beyond the owner’s control. A perfect example of a systemic market risk would be the Covid-19 virus that plaque the world today. Your restaurant business will be affected tremendously.

Fuddruckers just announced that they are selling their restaurants. Plus, market competitions sometimes go vicious that business owners end up looking for another niche to sell. All the other financial risks can be mitigated by the owner as the problem rises from within. With the credit risk, it is the owner’s fault of allowing excessive credit line to its customers and ending up unable to pay its own debt. The short sightedness of buying more real estate brought liquidity risk on them. Training employees on occupational hazards and having professional customer service will help mitigate the operational risk in the company.

##### ACTIVITY II:

###### Risk Reflection
In the previous section, we had you research types of risk, and in this one, we defined a few that are useful for this course. Of all of those, which are relevant to your day-to-day experiences?

###### Instructions
Consider your current company (or a friend's company if you're not currently working), what kind of risks is that company exposed to? How do they mitigate risk? What kinds of risks that weren't discussed here are relevant to your role?

###### ANSWER:

I used to own 4 restaurants and I sold it to my dearest friend. Systemic market risk such as Covid-19 brought my friend’s business to a halt. The temporary way out for this situation would be a quick revamp of staffing and nature of business. As they are not allowed to conduct dining in, they should concentrate in serving park dining, home delivery and outside catering. I would concentrate in manufacturing packed but almost fresh foods and sell it to the wholesaler.

Something that was not mentioned in this discussion is the importance of opportunity costs. We lost something every time we made mistakes in our decisions. Opportunity cost should be added into the equation of risk management. We may even name it the Risk Opportunity costs. With my friend’s situation right now, he is wasting and losing a lot of opportunity costs by concentrating on selling the restaurant instead of going back to the drawing board and do the afore mentioned niche above. By doing so, he might save his restaurant and his loyal staff.<br>

##### ACTIVITY III:

###### Ratio Deep Dive

Now that we have begun discussing different ways to compare investments, are there any methods that we haven't listed here?

###### Instructions

In this unit, we described the Sharpe, Sortino, and Information Ratios. Are there any other ratios you can find that are useful for comparing across portfolios? What information do they allow us to compare different potential investments? When would you use them?

##### ANSWER:

Including the potential market share of a new product or service would be a great measurement across portfolios. We can get the product-market fit by estimating the number of target customers and determining the market penetration rate and multiply it by the average value. Basically, market value = market volume multiplied by the average value. A prime example would be the Tesla cars. No matter what risk the owner, whether professional or personal, falls into, the expectation of a superb product coming out from their R&D surpasses all fears -- customers and shareholders will be on board.<br>

##### 0.3 Lesson Plan: Investing

###### ACTIVITY I:

###### Inflation Reflection
Now that we have discussed the implications of inflation on the value of money, let's consider how that affects us on a personal level.

##### Instructions

Consider your own personal investments, and your annual salary increases. Are you keeping up with, or beating inflation? How much larger would your annual increases need to be in order to avoid devaluation? If you're not currently employed, do research on the average entry salaries for the roles that you would like to take on. How much would those salaries need to increase each year to stay ahead of inflation?

###### ANSWER:

Without even looking at the data, we knew for a fact that inflation is unforgiving for those who relies only at their monthly salary. Thanks to the internet and the enthusiasm of financial institutions in reporting the paramount data day to day. All the reports are almost readily available in a touch of a button. The average Executive Director Salaries in the United States is about $79,417 per year. As a business owner wearing all the hats necessary to conduct the business, I considered myself on the level of an Executive Director. A 3.3% increase of salary per year would be great as the inflation rate is only 1.3%, but that is only on the salary side.

As a business owner, I also need my return of equity at about 15 to 20% to really feel being compensated after all those hard work and sleepless nights.<br>

##### ACTIVITY II:

###### Calculating TVM

In order to build some familiarity with the TVM equation, let's run through a quick practice problem

###### Instructions

You are presented three opportunities for investment:

An investment that will be worth $20,000 after 2 years, compounding semi-annually at 5% interest<br>
An investment that will be worth $15,000 after 1 year, compounding only once at 4% interest<br>
An investment that will be worth $18,000 after 1 year, compounding semi-annually at 8% interest<br>
Which investment values your present cash the highest? Which one seems riskiest? Which would you want to invest in? (Hint: This question does not have a straightforward answer)<br>

##### ANSWER:

FV = PV * [1+(i/n)] ^(n*t)<br>
PV = FV / [1+(i/n)] ^(n*t)<br>

FORMULA:<br>
PV = FV / [1+(i/n)] ^(n*t)<br>

FIRST INVESTMENT:<br>
PV = $20,000 / (1+.05) ^.05*4<br>
PV = $17,096.08 Highest Cash Investment<br>
Total Interest = $2,903.92 Highest Interest<br>
ROI per year = 0.08<br>

SECOND INVESTMENT:<br>
PV = $15,000 / (1+.04) ^.04*1<br>
PV = $14,423.08 Lowest Cash Investment<br>
Total Interest = $576.92 Lowest Interest<br>
ROI per year = 0.04<br>

THIRD INVESTMENT: MY BEST CHOICE <br>
PV = $18,000 / (1+.08) ^.08*2<br>
PV = $15,432.10<br>
Total Interest = $2,567.90<br>
ROI per year = 0.17<br>

|FUTURE VALUE   | INTEREST  | YEAR  | ROI/YR  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $17,096.08  |$2,903.92   | 2  | 0.08  | 
|$14,423.08   |$576.92   | 1  | 0.04  |
| $15,432.10   |$2,567.90   | 1  |  0.17 |

<br>
I would prefer the Third investment which will have a return of investment of 0.17. The difference of cash investment of the 2nd and 3rd are not that much, and the opportunity cost is nonbearing as both investments are only good for 1 year.<br>

 
##### ACTIVITY III:

###### Portfolio Comparisons

Now that we have discussed some of the core concepts in investing let's take a moment to look back at some of the themes, we've covered so far with regards to making comparisons across potential investments.

##### Instructions

In this unit, we have covered Modern Portfolio Theory along with the Time Value of Money. In prior sections, we also discussed Sharpe Ratios, Sortino Ratios, Information Ratios, Volatility, and the CAPM model. What does each of these pieces of information tell you about a portfolio that you may want to invest in? How can you use them to compare across multiple portfolios? Are there any metrics that you would give more or less weight to? How might you use these pieces of information to develop investment strategies?

###### ANSWER:

Proper planning, diligent execution, and correct timing is always my ideal investment strategy. Carefully checking all the math would be a part of the planning phase. Starting with Sharpe Ratio would be good as this provides comparison in an ideal world of risk-free investment. It should be followed by a Sortino ratio which differentiates harmful volatility. Adding the downside deviation is needed as a reality check.
The equation needs the importance of systemic risk together with benchmark comparison. Hence, CAPM and Information Ratio should be part of it. I never set aside the power of Fibonacci sequence in the formulation of my strategic investing.
The planning also includes breaking down between cash, fixed-income, securities, and stocks. I always consider myself as an aggressive investor betting 20 percent on fixed-income and 80 on stocks.

##### 0.5 Lesson Plan: Startup Survival Guide

##### ACTIVITY I:

##### Crunching Crunchbase
In the previous section we covered the different funding stages of startups. In this activity we'll explore the different funding rounds for a few companies we may recognize.

##### Instructions

Take a visit to Crunchbase, a site that tracks the the amount of funding companies receive and what stage in their rounds that they are. Look into any company you're interested in working for, or one that is local to your city. Does the size of their funding surprise you? Who all provided funding for that company?

##### ANSWER:

Tokensquare<br>
Pre-Seed<br>
Founder: Martin Rerak<br>
Location: Los Angeles<br>
Total Funding Amount: $25K<br>
Started: Jul 1, 2018<br>

Tokensquare is a beta deployment of BFF FEED. The concept of Tokensquare originates from the premise of a town square. The website is geared towards a central and trusted location and built as a curated blockchain, cryptocurrency news, media, jobs, and opportunity community portal. Pro members can list job openings, events, products, and services. Allowing influencers to maintain user attention and get more insight through curation.

Their problem was more on the execution side of the business. The owners admitted that their company is not worth investing as of now due to the low-quality volume content. The burdensome of continuously updating and researching current news and strategies viable for public eye strained the delivery of curation wherein professionals can have a better, faster and more focused way to stay on top of the latest developments and specific use cases of interest.
The 3 young and promising co-founders are still optimistic that they can work it out. Each of them has deep background in blockchain technology. They were fascinated on the fractional ownership as a unique value of asset tokenization, enhancing liquidity, efficiency, and empowering broad capital participation. Additional benefits can include automation, traceability, trust, and dynamic new asset classes.<br>
